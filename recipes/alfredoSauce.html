    <h1>Better-Than-Olive Garden Alfredo Sauce</h1>
    <p>This Olive Garden Alfredo sauce is better than the famous Italian restaurant chain's version. Alfredo sauce has always had my heart, whether chicken Alfredo or fettuccine Alfredo. This is a simple and basic recipe for Italian starters. Sprinkle some freshly chopped parsley over your plate for an added touch. Enjoy!</p>
