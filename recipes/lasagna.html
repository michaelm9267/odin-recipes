    <h2>Cook Time:</h2>
    <p>1 hour 15 minutes</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat: </strong>This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion and Garlic: </strong>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato Products: </strong>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar: </strong>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and Seasonings: </strong>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna Noodles: </strong>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses: </strong>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg: </strong>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and sugar. Add basil, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, salt, and black pepper to taste. Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, and parsley. Mix well and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Spread 1½ cups of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles over the meat sauce. Spread ⅓ of the ricotta mixture on top. Sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and cheeses on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, either spray the foil with cooking spray or ensure it doesn’t touch the cheese).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 25 minutes, or until the lasagna is bubbling and slightly golden on top.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
