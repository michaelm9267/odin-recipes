# Odin Recipes Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Odin Recipes** project! This project is part of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, designed to help aspiring developers build their foundational web development skills. This project focuses on creating a simple recipe website using pure HTML, demonstrating an understanding of basic HTML structure, semantic elements, and linking multiple pages together.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to practice and showcase the following skills:
- Structuring a webpage using HTML.
- Using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, and `<nav>`.
- Creating internal and external links for seamless navigation.
- Writing well-structured HTML code for readability and maintainability.

## Skills Demonstrated

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following:
1. **HTML Fundamentals**: Understanding of HTML5 tags, including headings, lists, paragraphs, links, and images.
2. **Organizing Multi-Page Websites**: Linking multiple HTML pages to create a functional website.
3. **Semantic HTML**: Using meaningful HTML elements to improve accessibility and structure.
4. **Attention to Detail**: Writing clean and valid HTML code.

## Project Overview

The **Odin Recipes** website consists of:
- A main index page listing the available recipes.
- Individual recipe pages for "World's Best Lasagna," "Fried Rice," and "Better-Than-Olive-Garden Alfredo Sauce."
- Simple and effective formatting achieved without using CSS.

## Reflection (Optional)

Upon completing the Odin Recipes project, I have gained confidence in writing and organizing HTML code. I learned how to create a cohesive website with multiple interconnected pages and gained a deeper understanding of HTML's capabilities and limitations when working without CSS.
